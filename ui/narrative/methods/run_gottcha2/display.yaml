     <p>This is a Narrative Method for running GOTTCHA2: a novel, gene-independent and signature-based metagenomic taxonomic profiling
method with significantly smaller false discovery rates (FDR) that is laptop deployable. The algorithm was
tested and validated on twenty synthetic and mock datasets ranging in community composition and complexity,
was applied successfully to data generated from spiked environmental and clinical samples, and robustly
demonstrates superior performance compared with other available tools.

	 <h3>Description</h3>
	 GOTTCHA2 offers two reference databases for classification, which are downloaded from the <a href="https://edge-dl.lanl.gov/GOTTCHA2/RefSeq-Release90/">GOTTCHA2 webserver page</a> (last updated 2018-11-10).  The databases are<p>
	 <ul>
	 <li> <b>RefSeq Bacteria and Viruses</b>: Nucleotide unique signature sequences built from NCBI RefSeq Release 90.
	 <li> <b>RefSeq Viruses</b>: Virus Nucleotide unique signature sequences built from NCBI RefSeq Release 90.
     </ul>
	 <h3>Notes</h3>
	 <p>
        GOTTCHAv2 is currently under development in BETA stage and paper in preparation. If you use the tool, you can cite the version 1 below.
